Leveraging Qiskit, OpenAI and LangChain to demonstrate Grover's algorithm

The following video discusses how to implement Grover's algorithm to solve a boolean satisfiability problem.

[Dinner Party using Grover's Algorithm â€” Coding with Qiskit S2E5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePr2MgQkqL0)

In the video, a boolean expression is manually constructed from a narrative that involves inviting friends to a dinner party.

This repository contains an update Jupyter notebook that provides the ability to generate the boolean expression from a narrative. A large language model from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), as well as the [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library, are leveraged to accomplish this.
